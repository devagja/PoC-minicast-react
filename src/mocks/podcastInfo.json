They also discuss if Em was speaking to Joe or not on his “Chloraseptic” remix, as well as Joe’s Twitter exchange with Bizzare (2:07). Also, Joe reveals that he is willing to rap again, but for one reason only (14:25). Last week Bruno Mars dropped the “Finesse” remix featuring Cardi B, which led the guys to ask, are we being forced to listen to Cardi at this point (19:30)? And Lupe vs Kendrick, who should be ranked higher on the “all-time” list (1:32:18). This episode is loaded, enjoy. Don’t forget to check out “Oh What a Night” at the Highline Ballroom on January 22!
